This is a project in java I made to play with the programming language.

As you may notice, I made use of interfaces to allow you to use the program.
One thing that interessed me on Java, is the fact that it allows me to create a desktop with windows that can spawn on it, so I made use of that to make this 
little project, and it's function extensions.

Beside the project is quite lacking, it kinda allows you to create a character, choose it's race (I was wanting to add a bearman race, 
but interest on this project ran out before I begun), and also change their facial expression and a number of body part colors.

I thought about making this be either a mini rpg, until I found out about two things that stopped me:
1) The JDK 7 or 8 is necessary if you want common users to run the project, and the JRE 7 or 8 is being discontinued in 2021 by Oracle, for some reason.
2) Oracle terms to use Java. After I read them, I wondered that I couldn't actually try making a living of this programming language, without previously have spent some on them.

At least was quite interesting for a while to mess with this.

And sorry if the source ends up being lacking. When trying to send it to github, I saw both bin and src folders. It didn't made much sense to send the bin folder, since seems 
like a compilation of the project to run on my pc, so I only sent the src folder.
